### Notes on running Demo with ESM

To run this demo using the ESM module system you have two options.
The first is to leave the file extenstions .mjs and node will figure it out.
The second, and preferred option, is to change the file extentions to .js
and use the package.json file to indicate that you are using the "module" type
import system.

I've include an example of this named __package.json this this option
already set. You will need to rename it to package.json file for it to be used.
